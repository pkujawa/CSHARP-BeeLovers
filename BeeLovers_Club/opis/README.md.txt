BeeLovers Club
You've just joined the club which breeds bees and produces honey.
As a member of the club, you get 1$ every 5 seconds - which u can only trade for flowers. 
You are getting more and more flowers - after short amount of time (30s) the smell of flowers lures a bee. With time, more bees will be coming.
Bees produce honey. It requires nectar. Amount of nectar grows in time (every second), with the speed of growth depending on the amount of flowers. 
Its value decreases as it is collected by bees - every 10 seconds. Amount of collected nectar depends on the amount of bees.
Amount of nectar stored grows every 10 seconds - when bees deliver it to the hive.
You can try to contact Mark - but he will reveal himself after you produce your first jar of honey.
One jar of honey is produced when you collect 900g of nectar.
Mark asks you to give him 3 jars of honey in exhange for a special hive. You can trust him - or not.
If you dont call him, every time you collect at least 4 jars of honey, bears will make you a visit and steal all your supplies.
When you call Mark, he will take 3 jars of honey and you will never see him again - but he will also lure bears away and they won't also appear anymore.
While playing the game, you will be getting special titles next to your name, depending on your choices and your level of mastery in Bee-breeding.
